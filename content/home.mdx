<h1 class="text-3xl">Hey, I'm Matheus</h1>

<Spacer />

I am a software engineer based in Lisboa, Portugal. I am currently working at Celfocus. 

This website is my humble abode on the internet, where I pen my musings in [here](/posts) and [here](/notes) about software development, specifically JavaScript, TypeScript and web technologies in general. 

If you enjoy my content, consider subscribing to my [RSS feed](/rss.xml). If you feel so inclined, you're welcome to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/matheusmazeto).
